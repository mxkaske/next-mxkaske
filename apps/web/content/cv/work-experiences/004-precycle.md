I co-founded [precycle](https://precycle.today) with the idea of combining purpose and technology. With the [EXIST](https://www.exist.de/EXIST/Navigation/en) funding program, private funding and a remote working team of up to 8 people, our vision has been to recreate a compensation [funding funnel] system for e-commerce similar to CO2 but in the plastic waste sector as “money doesn’t go where the trash goes”.

I was responsible for developing our technical infrastructure and making things happen: from idea to production. Managing two engineers, at peak, and working closely with Design and Marketing required strong team player abilities, providing feedback and reviewing code. Over more than a year, we have been developing multiple applications to fit our defined roadmap: **Marketing Page**, **Member Dashboard**, **Shopify App**, **REST API** and **Plastic Footprint Calculator**.

My role was much more than engineering. I was responsible for most of our internal operations, resulting in creating database structures for specific use cases, creating file structures and providing tools that allowed us to be more productive. I was also responsible for external communication with our partners and the collaboration that resulted from it.

Overall, I learned how to build a start-up environment and improve it over time.
