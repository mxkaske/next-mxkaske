I co-founded [precycle](https://precycle.today), a start-up tackling climate change through the compensation of plastic waste, with the idea of combining purpose and technology. With the [EXIST](https://www.exist.de/EXIST/Navigation/DE/Home/home.html) funding program, private funding and a remote working team of up to 8 people, our vision has been to recreate a compensation [funding funnel] system for e-commerce similar to CO2 but in the plastic waste sector as “money doesn’t go where the trash goes”.

As co-founder and head of product development, I was responsible for developing our technical infrastructure and making things happen: from concept to production. Managing up to two engineers and working closely with Design and Marketing allowed me to further improve my project and team management skills. I was also in charge of reviewing code and providing constructive feedback. Over more than a year and under my guidance, we developed multiple applications to fit our defined roadmap. These include: **Marketing Page**, **Member Dashboard**, **Shopify App**, **REST API** and [**Plastic Footprint Calculator**](https://footprint.precycle.today).

My role included much more than the technical engineering. I was responsible for most of our internal operations and led the development of database structures for specific use cases, creating file structures and providing tools that allowed us to be more productive. I was also responsible for external communication with our partners and the collaboration that resulted from it.
