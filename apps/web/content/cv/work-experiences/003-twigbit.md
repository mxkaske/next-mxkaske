I have supported [Twigbit](https://twigbit.com/) in building the foundation of [Brimo](https://brimo.io/), a Facility Management Tool. With the Engineering Team, we had to assess which framework, state management system, database,â€¦ to use. While helping extend the source code, I was responsible to build the design system components and the code patterns behind it.
