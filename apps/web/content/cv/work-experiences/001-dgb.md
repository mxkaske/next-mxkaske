While everything starts with fixing printer issues, I soonish started working at the [Typo3 CMS](https://typo3.org/) of the official website [pneumologie.de](https://pneumologie.de) by creating extensions in **PHP** and changing some frontend styles over time. I finally co-created their congress platform [pneumologie-kongress.de](https://pneumologie-kongress.de/) with typo3, as well as [zukunft.pneumologie.de](https://zukunft.pneumologie.de/) that has been build with a **Symphony** backend and a **React** frontend.
