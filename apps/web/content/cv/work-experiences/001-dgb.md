As a student IT assistant at the DGP I worked on the [Typo3 CMS](https://typo3.org/) of the official website [pneumologie.de](http://pneumologie.de/) by creating extensions in **PHP** and changing frontend styles as requested. I then co-created the organisation’s congress platform [pneumologie-kongress.de](http://pneumologie-kongress.de/) with typo3, as well as [zukunft.pneumologie.de](http://zukunft.pneumologie.de/) which was built using a **Symphony** backend and a **React** frontend. This early work experience allowed me to improve my coding skills, learn how to fix bugs and how to work on complex projects.
