We've been building [precycle.today](https://precycle.today) to allow plastic compensation. Similar to CO2 but differently. Instead of planting trees, we would collect and process plastic waste in low income nations. My task has been to build our technical infrastructure based on our roadmap. We had to get together a **member login dashboard**, **marketing website** and **Shopify App**. The Shopify App has been our first product, with which a merchant could include a banner in their checkout process so that their customer had the choice of compensating their purchase. Moreover, we started a **plastic footprint prototype** [footprint.precycle.today](https://footprint.precycle.today), calculating an individuals yearly plastic consumption based on the answer of dedicated questions. All projects shared as much code as possible and thanks to **turborepo**, it was simple to maintain.

At peak, I managed two engineers while working on the company. Over more than a year, I learned how to priotize work, introduced multiple tools to simplify work, learned how to analyze website's data, created dozens of **Notion** database relations including formulas and grew our workspace so it would fit our use case.
