At [Lindgruen](https://www.lindgruen-gmbh.com/en/), my main task has been self-directing the [_Leila PRO_](https://www.leila.de/de/) App development based on an existing [4D](https://us.4d.com) database and predefined UI. Leila creates horizontal access to medical guidelines that is suitable for everyday use. It is backed up and linked with scores, pathways, glossaries, epidemiological data and other reliable knowledge. It’s been developed with **React Native** and **Expo** for the Android and iOS App and the PWA is rendered with **React Native Web**.

While continuously developing Leila, I’ve had the chance to build two more Apps with **React Native**: the [_ASH Quiz_](https://www.aktion-sauberehaende.de/krankenhauser/fortbildungsmaterialien/spielerische-wege), familiar instructions for action in relation to medical activities, and a _Contact Diary_ in corona times that unfortunately never got released due to App Store CoVid-19 restrictions.
