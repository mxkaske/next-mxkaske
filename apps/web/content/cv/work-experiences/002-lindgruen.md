At [Lindgr端n](https://www.lindgruen-gmbh.com/en/), my main task was solely responsible for the [Leila PRO](https://www.leila.de/de/) App development based on an existing [4D](https://us.4d.com/) database and predefined UI. Leila is an App that creates horizontal access to medical guidelines suitable for everyday use. It is backed up by and linked with scores, pathways, glossaries, epidemiological data and other reliable knowledge.

When I joined Lindgr端n I was put in charge of the still ongoing project. Despite my at that time, limited knowledge of **React Native**, I proved my ability to quickly adapt to new work environments by quickly improving my React Native proficiency and successfully refactoring the whole codebase from Javascript and Class Components into a Typescript and Functional Components driven source code for better maintenance. In addition, I supported my supervisor by developing a 4D RESTful API to allow an easy communication with the App.

In short: I was responsible for all relevant steps from development to production of the App.

While continuously developing Leila, I had the chance to build two more Apps: the _[ASH Quiz](https://www.aktion-sauberehaende.de/krankenhauser/fortbildungsmaterialien/spielerische-wege)_ , which allows for the familiarisation with instructions and actions related to medical activities, and an interpersonal Contact Diary in the early stages of the CoVid-Pandemic, which unfortunately never got released due to App Store CoVid-19 restrictions.
