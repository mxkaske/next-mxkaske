At [Lindgruen](https://www.lindgruen-gmbh.com/en/), my main task has been self-directing the _[Leila PRO](https://www.leila.de/de/)_ App development based on an existing [4D](https://us.4d.com/) database and predefined UI. Leila creates horizontal access to medical guidelines that are suitable for everyday use. It is backed up and linked with scores, pathways, glossaries, epidemiological data and other reliable knowledge.

I took over an unfinished project that still required work. I learned **React Native** within a short period of time and refactored the whole codebase from JS and Class Components into a TS and Functional Components driven source code for better maintenance. I supported my supervisor and co-worker by developing a 4D RESTful API to allow an easy communication with the App.

In short: I was responsible from development to production.

While continuously developing Leila, I had the chance to build two more Apps with React Native: the _[ASH Quiz](https://www.aktion-sauberehaende.de/krankenhauser/fortbildungsmaterialien/spielerische-wege)_, familiar instructions for action in relation to medical activities, and a _Contact Diary_ for the early corona days that unfortunately never got released due to App Store CoVid-19 restrictions.
