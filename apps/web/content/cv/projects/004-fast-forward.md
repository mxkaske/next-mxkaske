Coding is my passion, so is this project. Open source, blog posts and the entire community is a big motivation to thrive towards a common goal: building block by block an environment where everybody can build on top of it.

Inspired by [feedback.fish](http://feedback.fish), the goal is to build a simple Feedback Widget that anyone can easily install on their website. The feedback collected will be shown on the dashboard with additional useful informations like browser, timestamp and more. Itâ€™s under construction and will maybe never see the light. But it help improving my skills.
