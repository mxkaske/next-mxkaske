It's been a test project for working with the following main packages: `next`, `next-auth`, `tailwindcss`, `prisma`, `planetscale`, `cloudinary`.

I've been also testing Next.js newly published middleware to add subdomains. The database is not running anymore but the project can still be viewed at [GitHub](https://github.com/mxkaske/qwk.st) or [qwk.st](https://qwk.st).
