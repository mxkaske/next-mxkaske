The best way to learn is to build. Itâ€™s a simple **Next.js** project with the goal of recreating a small [linktr.ee](http://linktr.ee) alternative. I tested the possibilities of Next.js on frontend and backend side. Like creating custom subdomains with middleware, working with serverless databases and integrating user authentification.

The database is not running anymore but the project can still be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/mxkaske/qwk.st).
