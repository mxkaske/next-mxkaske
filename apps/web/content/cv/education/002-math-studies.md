I studied **Mathematics** at the _Technische Universit√§t Berlin_ where I specialized in Algorithmic Discrete Mathematics (ADM). I wrote my Bachelor Thesis on the topic of _Optimization of large-scale Order-Stock-Container-Allocation_, a specific multi-dimensional knapsack problem that many logistic centers face. The goal was to develop an algorithm that maximizes the number of demands served and minimizes the number of containers used to serve all demands in a warehouse. All code was written in **Python**.
