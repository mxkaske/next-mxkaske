I studied Mathematics at the _Technische Universit√§t Berlin_ where I specialised in Algorithmic Discrete Mathematics (ADM). My Bachelor Thesis was about _Optimization of large-scale Order-Stock-Container-Allocation_, a specific multi-dimensional knapsack problem. The algorithm supporting the work has been written in Python.
