I studied **Mathematics** at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin where I specialized in Algorithmic Discrete Mathematics (ADM). My Bachelor Thesis was about the _Optimization of large-scale Order-Stock-Container-Allocation_, a specific multi-dimensional knapsack problem that many logistic centers have. The goal has been mainly to develop an algorithm that: maximizes the number of demands served and minimizes the number of containers used to serve all demands in a warehouse. The code has been written in **Python**.
