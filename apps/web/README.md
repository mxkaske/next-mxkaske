Contentlayer [Issue #104](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/104): Setting up contentlayer inside a turborepo

TODO:

- [ ] Refactor projects to contentlayer types `Building` (e.g.) to allow more context. Include attributes like technolgies used, time range,...
- [ ] Use the `Project` to create a CV like timeline of work that has been done. Include an image and basic data from you(!).
- [ ] Use a print or a download to pdf button (via print) - hide header and footer on print (tailwindcss utility class)
