## Calculator

TODO:

- In case we would like the user to choose between different cards, the [Tab Component](https://headlessui.dev/react/tabs) from headlessui could be a help. As `<Tab.Panel>` could be displayed the description of the answer or facts. We would need extend the type `QuestionSelectOption` with a new _description_ prop.
- **How to create nested Questions?** This would mean to rethink of the type `Footprint` and make it maybe more generic. Think of using a "dependOn" property like `turborepo`.
- Check Co2-Calculator
