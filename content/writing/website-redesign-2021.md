## Website redesign at the end of the year

The first design of the website was build more or less exactly one year ago, in December 2020. It was meant to be a "portfolio" page where I would present my projects and the frameworks, libraries I've been using.

If you wonder how it looked like:

Back then, I was mostly working on Mobile Applications. It was the first website build with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org). A personal website is a playground where you experiment with new tools. Using it with the utility classes from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) was one of the biggest take aways I had and that are unthinkable when building in the web.

> Tailwindcss makes the experience of styling a lot more fun.

It doesn't mean that you don't have to know _CSS_ but it creates this **consistency** and **easy to access** styling in your code.

A lot of my learnings over this year, fully working on web development, are represented in the new _UI/UX_ and the _code_.

If you are a developer interested in UI, have a look at the book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) written by the makers from tailwindcss. I really recommend it.

With that site, I am challenging myself to only work with _gray tones_, _typography (size, weight, font,...)_ to keep it calm and minimal.

Also, props to the following sites I have been inspired from (they look way better):
