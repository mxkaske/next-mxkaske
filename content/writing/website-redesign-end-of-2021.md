## Website redesign at the end of the year

The first design of the website was build one year ago. It was meant to be a "portfolio" page where I would present my projects and the frameworks / libraries I've been using.

If you wonder how it looked like (dark vs. light):

Two points you may have noticed:

- The chosen colors palette has bad gradations
- The text components are too monotone (this might come from the chosen monospace font...) and misses some hierarchy on the page

Back then, I was mostly working on Mobile Applications. It was the first website build with [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org). A personal website is a playground where you experiment with new tools. Using it with the utility classes from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) was one of the biggest take aways I had and that are unthinkable when building in the web.

> Tailwindcss makes the experience of styling a lot more fun in web development.

It doesn't mean that you don't have to know _CSS_ but it creates this **consistency** and **easy to access** styling in your code. I talked about the experience of [Styling in React Native](/writing/how-to-style-in-react-native-with-restyle) and the advantage to not have to leave the tempate code, be it `html` or `react-native`, and not having to remember the class names you invited.

A lot of my learnings over this year, fully working on web development, are represented in the new _UI/UX_ and the _code_ (see [GitHub](https://github.com/maximiliankaske/next-mxkaske)).

If you are a developer interested in UI, have a look at the book [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com) written by the makers from tailwindcss. I really recommend it.

With that site, I am challenging myself to only work with _gray tones_, _typography (size, weight, font,...)_ to keep it calm and minimal.

Also, props to the following sites I have been inspired from (they look way better):

- [frankchimero.com](https://frankchimero.com)
- [paco.me](https://paco.me)
- [cmhb.de](https://cmhb.de)

And let's see what I will come up with next year! Learning brings changes.
